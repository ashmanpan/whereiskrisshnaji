## 🐛 Known Issues (Minor)

### Chatbot:
- First query might be slow (Lambda cold start ~2-3 seconds)
- Subsequent queries will be faster
- This is normal for serverless functions

### Timezone:
- Uses coordinate-based detection (approximation)
- Might not be 100% accurate for border regions
- Works well for major cities

### Authentication:
- Simple session-based auth
- Good for demo, recommend Cognito for production

**None of these are blocking issues - everything works!**
