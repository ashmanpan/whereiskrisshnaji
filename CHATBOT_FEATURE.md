## Technical Implementation

### Components Created

**1. ChatBot.jsx**
- Main chatbot component
- Manages chat state and messages
- Integrates with BedrockChatbot-API
- Fetches location context from DynamoDB

**2. ChatBot.css**
- Modern, gradient-based design
- Smooth animations
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Typing indicators

### API Integration

**Bedrock API Endpoint:**
```
POST https://3vu1g7u9qc.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/chat
```

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "message": "Where is Krishnaji today?",
  "context": "System prompt with location data..."
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "response": "AI-generated answer...",
  "message": "Alternative response field"
}
```

### Location Context Generation

The chatbot automatically generates context from DynamoDB:

```javascript
const context = `
Current date: 2025-10-23

CURRENT LOCATION:
Krishnaji is currently in Mumbai, India from 2025-10-25 to 2025-10-27.

UPCOMING TRIPS:
- Delhi, India: 2025-11-01 to 2025-11-03 (planned)
- Bangalore, India: 2025-11-15 to 2025-11-18 (planned)

RECENT TRIPS:
- Chennai, India: 2025-10-10 to 2025-10-12
`;
```

This context is sent with every query to provide accurate, data-driven responses.

## Example Conversations

### Example 1: Current Location

    ‚Üì
Fetch Locations from DynamoDB (via locationService)
    ‚Üì
Generate Context (current, upcoming, recent trips)
    ‚Üì

```

### Context Preparation

1. **Fetch all locations** from DynamoDB
2. **Sort by date** (past, current, future)
3. **Identify current location** (today's date within range)
4. **Get upcoming trips** (next 5 future locations)
5. **Get recent trips** (last 3 completed trips)
6. **Format as text context** for the AI

### AI Processing

The Bedrock API receives:
- **User Question**: The actual query
- **System Context**: Formatted location data
- **System Prompt**: Instructions to be helpful and accurate

Claude processes this and generates a natural language response.

- **Cost:** First 1M requests free
- **Expected:** $0/month

### Lambda
- **Invocations:** 100/day
- **Duration:** ~2 seconds each
- **Cost:** Within free tier
- **Expected:** $0/month

### DynamoDB
- **Reads for context:** 1 per query
