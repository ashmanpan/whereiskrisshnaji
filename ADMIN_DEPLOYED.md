## How Data Storage Works

### Current Implementation (Phase 1)

**Storage:** Browser localStorage
- Data is stored in your browser
- Persists across sessions
- Private to your browser only

**Important Notes:**
- If you clear browser data, locations will be lost
- Different browsers/devices won't sync
- **Always download backups regularly!**

**Public Site:**
- Visitors see the same data you add in admin panel
- Data is embedded in the published site
- Updates require you to update from admin panel

### Future (Phase 2)

- AWS backend database
- Multi-device synchronization
- Android app integration
- Automatic GPS updates

   ```

3. Rebuild and deploy:

   ./update-and-deploy.sh
   ```

### Option 2: AWS Amplify Console
